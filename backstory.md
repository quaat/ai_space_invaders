> Are you familiar with the game "space invaders"?
Yes, I'm familiar with Space Invaders. It is a classic arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released by Taito in 1978. In the game, players control a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and their goal is to defend the Earth from waves of descending alien invaders. The aliens move from side to side and gradually advance towards the bottom of the screen. Players must shoot down the invaders while avoiding their projectiles and the occasional flying saucer that passes by overhead.

Space Invaders was a major commercial success and had a significant impact on the video game industry. It helped to popularize the shoot 'em up genre and pave the way for future arcade and home console games. Its iconic pixelated characters, sound effects, and gameplay have made it a beloved classic and an important piece of video game history.

> Great! Today we will be making our own version of the game with PyGame. We have all the necessary sprites in .png files. Set up the main game field, by populating the alien invaders in 11 columns and 5 rows at the top of the page. We have 4 different types of alien invaders, so the bottom 2 rows will consist of the same type. The player will control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen. Movement will be controlled by pressing the arrow buttons left and right. In addition, our spaceship will shoot upwards by pressing `space`. The bullets will also be a loaded from a .png file. If the bullet hits an alien, the alien ship will disappear and 10 points are granted. The alien ships from the bottom row will also shoot bullets downward. If a bullet hits our spaceship, it is game over.

Now you have a basic Space Invaders game using Pygame. The alien ships are arranged in rows and columns, and the player can move left and right using the arrow keys while shooting using the spacebar. The aliens at the bottom row will randomly shoot bullets downward. When a bullet hits an alien ship, the ship disappears, and the player earns 10 points. If a bullet hits the player's spaceship, the game ends.

You can further enhance the game by adding more features, such as a scoring system, lives, different levels, or sound effects.

the image sprites are a bit too large, please scale all images to an appropriate size

[ CODE GENERATED ]

Now, the images will be scaled down to 50% of their original size. You can adjust the scale_factor variable to any desired value between 0 and 1 to scale the images accordingly. Make sure to keep it as a float (e.g., 0.5) to avoid integer division issues.

change the game logic such that the alien ships will move from back and forth horizontally, and gradually come down and closer to the player ship. If the the alien ships reach the player ship, the game ends. If the player is able to shoot down all alien ships, the game is reset with new aliens, but this time they will move increasingly faster for each re-spawn. In addition, the shooting frequency of the alien ships will increase.

Now, the alien ships will move back and forth horizontally and gradually come down. If the alien ships reach the player ship or the player gets hit by an alien bullet, the game ends. If the player shoots down all alien ships, the game resets with new aliens, and they move increasingly faster for each respawn. Additionally, the shooting frequency of the alien ships will increase.

With these changes, the game's difficulty will progressively increase as the player successfully clears each wave of aliens. The alien ships will move faster and shoot more frequently, presenting an ongoing challenge for the player.
